"""Canonical SWC byte form + content hashes.

Implements the canonicalization rules from ``docs/PROVENANCE_SPEC.md``
section 2. Every other piece of the provenance system anchors on these
two functions, so they must be small, deterministic, and never change
their behavior across v1.x.

Rules (frozen for v1):

============================  =====================================
Aspect                         Rule
============================  =====================================
Line endings                   normalized to ``\\n``
Trailing whitespace            stripped per line
Float format                   pass-through (no rounding/reformatting)
Comment lines (``#``)          included in hash, **except** lines
                               starting with ``# @PROV``
Node ordering                  as-written (do not sort)
Hash algorithm                 SHA-256
Encoding                       UTF-8 strict
============================  =====================================

The exclusion of ``# @PROV`` lines is what makes the in-file
provenance header (spec §5) cycle-free: writing the header about a
state cannot recursively change that state's own hash.
