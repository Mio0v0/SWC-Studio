# Getting Started

This guide gets a new user to a working `SWC-Studio` install and a first successful run.

## Installation paths

There are three supported ways to install:

| Method | Best for | Models bundled? |
|---|---|---|
| **Option 1 — bundled desktop app** | end users who want a double-clickable application | yes, inside the app |
| **Option 2 — `pip install swcstudio`** | researchers using SWC-Studio in scripts / Python | yes, inside the wheel |
| **Option 3 — install from source** | developers who want to modify the code itself | yes, in the local checkout |

## Supported Python versions

Options 2 and 3 require **Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12** already installed on your system.

Python 3.12 is the recommended default. Newer Python releases are added
only after the compiled scientific dependencies and the pinned model
runtime have been validated together.

Option 1 (the bundled app) ships its own Python runtime — no separate Python install needed.

## Option 1 — Bundled desktop app

Use this path if you only need the desktop application and don't want to deal with Python.

1. open <https://github.com/Mio0v0/SWC-Studio/releases/latest>
2. download `SWC-Studio-vX.Y.Z-macOS.zip` (Mac) or `SWC-Studio-vX.Y.Z-Windows.zip` (Windows)
3. extract and launch:
   - **macOS** — drag `SWC-Studio.app` into `/Applications`, then double-click. First launch may need `xattr -cr /Applications/SWC-Studio.app` (or right-click → Open) because the bundle is not yet code-signed.
   - **Windows** — extract anywhere, run the `.exe` inside.

The auto-typing models are bundled inside the app, so the first auto-label
call works without any download. Release executables are intended to be
portable CPU builds. Use a pip or source install for GPU acceleration.

## Option 2 — `pip install` from PyPI

Use this path for the desktop GUI, scripts, Jupyter notebooks, batch
processing, or any Python workflow. Create a new virtual environment so
the `python`, `pip`, `swcstudio`, and `swcstudio-gui` commands all refer
to the same installation.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3.12 -m venv ~/swcstudio-env
source ~/swcstudio-env/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install swcstudio
swcstudio doctor
swcstudio-gui
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv $HOME\swcstudio-env
& $HOME\swcstudio-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install swcstudio
swcstudio doctor
swcstudio-gui
```

That single `python -m pip install swcstudio` command installs every
Python runtime requirement: the scientific stack, PyTorch and
torch-geometric, XGBoost and scikit-learn, PySide6, VisPy, pyqtgraph,
and the history/provenance libraries. The wheel also contains all
runtime JSON configuration and all eight production models. There is
no separate requirements file, model download, or `[gui]` extra.

The CI release gate installs the built wheel into an empty virtual
environment and runs model deserialization, GUI imports, and inference
on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

To upgrade later: `python -m pip install --upgrade swcstudio`. The new
wheel installs the matching code, configuration, and production models.

If `swcstudio doctor` reports an executable outside the environment you
created, run the commands by absolute environment path, for example
`~/swcstudio-env/bin/swcstudio-gui` on macOS/Linux or
`$HOME\swcstudio-env\Scripts\swcstudio-gui.exe` on Windows.

## Option 3 — Source install (development)

Use this path if you want to modify the swcstudio code itself. The `-e`
flag installs in **editable** mode, meaning edits to local `.py` files
take effect on the next `python` run — no reinstall needed.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mio0v0/SWC-Studio.git
cd SWC-Studio
```

One command installs everything — the CLI, the desktop GUI, the
auto-typing engine (sklearn + torch + torch_geometric), and the
bundled model files:

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

The editable install includes the complete scientific, ML, desktop GUI,
visualization, and history runtime. New users do not need to install a
separate requirements file or GUI extra.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

### Conda

```bash
conda create -n swc-studio python=3.12 -y
conda activate swc-studio
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

### Optional developer extras

For maintainers who need PyInstaller (release packaging) and Sphinx
(docs build):

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

End users do not need this.

## Updating

How you update depends on how you installed:

| Install method | How to update |
|---|---|
| Option 1 (bundled app) | Help → **Check for Updates** in the GUI. The in-app updater downloads only the changed layer (~5 MB code or ~80 MB models), no full re-download. |
| Option 2 (pip) | `python -m pip install --upgrade swcstudio` installs the matching code, dependencies, configuration, and bundled models. |
| Option 3 (source) | `git pull` followed by `python -m pip install -e .` to pick up any new dependencies or metadata. |

Internally, each release is split into three independent layers — runtime,
code, and models — so most updates only re-fetch the small ones. See
[`packaging/MODULAR_BUILD.md`](https://github.com/Mio0v0/SWC-Studio/blob/main/packaging/MODULAR_BUILD.md)
for the architecture details.

## Verify installation

```bash
swcstudio --help
swcstudio doctor
swcstudio models status
swcstudio gpu-status
swcstudio-gui --help
```

If a console script is not on your path, fall back to module mode:

```bash
python -m swcstudio.cli.cli --help
python -m swcstudio.gui.main
```

`swcstudio models status` is worth running once after install: it
prints the auto-typing engine's model search path and confirms the
bundled v12 model files are reachable. You should see the core files
`cell_type_classifier.pkl`, `branch_classifier.pkl`,
`gnn_apical_basal.pt`, `gnn_branch3_rescue.pt`, and `qc_gate.pkl`
listed as `[FOUND]`, plus flag model paths when flag scoring is bundled.

`swcstudio gpu-status` is optional. It explains whether the active pip or
source environment can use CUDA, and what is missing when it cannot. The
GUI exposes the same check under Help -> GPU Readiness. For setup
details, see [GPU Setup](GPU_INSTALL.md).

## First CLI checks

Start with a read-only inspection command:

```bash
swcstudio check cell.swc
swcstudio validate cell.swc
```

Then try an edit command:

```bash
swcstudio auto-label cell.swc
swcstudio set-type cell.swc --node-id 14169 --new-type 3
swcstudio simplify cell.swc
swcstudio connect cell.swc --start-id 10 --end-id 22
```

Single-file edit commands update the source SWC directly and record the
operation in `<stem>_history.swcstudio` next to the file. No separate
`--write` flag is required.

`auto-label` always applies soma / axon / basal labeling, detects apical
labels when appropriate, and can flag cells whose predicted labels look
unreliable. Use `--cell-type pyramidal` or `--cell-type interneuron`
when you already know the cell type; leave it unknown to run Stage 1.

## First GUI checks

Launch the GUI:

```bash
swcstudio-gui
```

Then:

1. open an SWC file
2. review the automatically generated issue list
3. select an issue and let the app route you to the matching repair tool
4. save or close the file to keep the original SWC updated and record
   the operation in history

## Default outputs

For a source file:

- `<folder>/<stem>.swc`

the default single-file output directory is:

- `<folder>/<stem>_swc_studio_output/`

That legacy-compatible directory is used mainly for explicitly requested
single-file validation reports and report-only exports.

Other materialized outputs use their operation-specific location:

- batch split creates a timestamped batch output directory
- history checkout writes the requested output path (or its documented default)
- history checkpoint writes a labeled SWC next to the source

GUI and mutating CLI edits are recorded in the per-file history archive
next to the SWC:

- `<stem>_history.swcstudio`
